## INTRO

Solar Analysis is very important for residential projects to create comfortable environment. Some countries have very strict local codes (Russia, for example) and Solar Analysis required by local authorities. Solar Analysis is a really complex process when youâ€™re working without automation.
LUCIOLA helps to not only correctly calculate number of hours of insolation, but also to analyze environmental buildings and the site itself. All results are visually represented.

## FEATURES

* Accurate and precise calculation
* Visual representation
* Visual retrace analysis
* Cutting of environment building for retrace rays
* Interface
* Advanced export of analysis results to BIM tools (ARCHICAD, REVIT)

## INTERFACE

**LUCIOLA** interface contains settings required for Solar Analysis and working with model.
LUCIOLA interface tabs:

* Main
* Tools
* Units
* Display
* Location
* Info
